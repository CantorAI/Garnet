# Qwen3.8 RTX5090 research log

## Record policy

Append dated experiment entries; do not rewrite failed experiments into successes.
Use one fixed remote root `D:\CantorAI\5090-study-20261023`, one shared model cache,
and a flat `results` directory. Reuse build directories; keep accepted control
binaries and hashes separately from candidate output. Remove transfer archives
only after verified extraction. Keep compact raw JSONL and paper evidence; prune
rebuildable engines only when they are not needed by an active comparison.

For every future optimization record: experiment ID/time in UTC and local zone;
hypothesis; exact source diff and SHA-256; build flags/toolchain; model revision,
quantization, calibration and kernel dispatch; workload IDs and input hashes;
prompt/image token counts, output tokens, seeds, thinking/cache settings;
batch and client concurrency; control/candidate order; warmups and repetitions;
correctness and quality results; all raw latency/token/memory observations;
median/p95 and uncertainty; profiler configuration/overhead; failures;
interpretation, decision and limitations. Record power/temperature/clocks and
background load. Retain rejected candidates and interrupted runs as such.

Measurements, shape/memory estimates, hypotheses, and vendor claims are separate
evidence classes. Synthetic unit fixtures are not benchmark observations. GPU
profiling attribution is not production serving latency. No cherry-picked cohort
or changed precision/workload may silently support a 2x speedup claim.

## P000 — 2026-10-23: source and compatibility audit

Method: inspect the current Garnet working tree, retrieve pinned primary model
configs, compare architecture/quantization contracts and query target hardware
over SSH. The referenced chat exposed only message placeholders for prior
assistant claims, so no prior predicted token/s or TTFT is treated as evidence.

Source HEAD: `5b0dc7ff8e5c1a77807138db310605bcd12aa390`.
The original branch is `feature/gpt-oss-120b`, with substantial ongoing Qwen3.5
edits. A separate local worktree at `D:\CantorAI\work\qwen38-5090` uses branch
`qwen38-5090`. Current source was preserved through a per-file hashed snapshot;
its pre-existing dirty baseline is not attributed to this task or silently
committed. Future runs must retain both HEAD and complete source hashes.

Base source archive SHA-256:
`7c29e60a515827464a7fb0fa461d45bc0d5a91f93f6c00c7b7e476a1f8be9d99`.
Remote extraction verified that digest. `source-manifest.json` lists captured
Garnet/XLang3 files and exclusions; `preparation-manifest.json` supersedes
preparation files changed after the base snapshot. No credentials are included.

Observations: Qwen3.8-27B exists and uses Qwen3.5-family hybrid VLM architecture.
The 27B decoder, untied head and larger vision tower differ from the admitted
2B/4B models. NVIDIA's checkpoint mixes NVFP4 and FP8. A compressed-tensors
group128 symmetric W4A16 candidate is pinned, but not runtime-admitted. See the
implementation task and checkpoint evidence for exact revision/config hashes.

Target observation: Windows `zsdx-5090`, one RTX5090, 32607 MiB, driver617.14,
CUDA toolkit12.8. Existing `D:\CantorAI\Garnet` is deployment content, not a
buildable checkout. Preserved it and staged source under the fixed study root.
No target model weights were downloaded during preparation.

Outcome: 27B CUDA serving admission and packed NVFP4/FP8 integration are pending.
Current BF16 external projections and captured INT4 dequantization cannot be
treated as a working ModelOpt loader. No performance result or speedup exists.

## P001 — 2026-10-23: CPU preparation validation

Method: run `python -m unittest discover -s test2026/cuda/qwen38_5090 -p test_*.py -v`
locally with Python3.12.10 and remotely with `C:\Python312\python.exe` on
CD-RTX5090. Run offline preflight on the pinned NVIDIA config on both hosts.

Outcome: all9 tests passed on each host. Evidence-integrity checks validate
checkpoint-config hashes; negative tests reject incompatible model shapes and
bad timing records. Synthetic metric fixtures test correct decode token counts,
cohort throughput denominator, failed-request rejection and comparison against
the faster of both engines. These are CPU tests, not GPU inference validation.

Calculated B1/context4096 canonical-state sizes: attention KV536870912 bytes,
FP32 recurrent matrices150994944 bytes, convolution history7864320 bytes.
These omit weights, graphs, duplicated state, vision, activations and workspace;
they do not establish peak VRAM or prove fit on32GB.

## P002 — 2026-10-23: environment preparation

Method: start native CMake/Ninja/Visual Studio2022 Build Tools installation with
logs in the fixed remote root. User authorized WSL installation for reference
baselines. Installed WSL3.0.3 and enabled VirtualMachinePlatform without reboot.
Windows reports a restart is required before changes take effect. Native build
tools were still downloading at this entry; installation success is unverified.
Garnet remains a native Windows build. WSL is reserved for reference engines.

Outcome: baseline engines, native Release build, target GPU correctness,
quantized model fit and timed measurements remain pending. Do not publish
preparation timings as TTFT or claim the >=2x target is achieved.

## P003 — 2026-10-23: setup failure and alternate method

The initial CMake winget download failed with InternetOpenUrl error0x80072efd
(recorded installer exit -2147012867). Preserve its original log and status.
Stopped only this task's first setup process and its direct winget child to
avoid competing installers. Retry uses official PyPI CMake/Ninja wheels in
`tools/python` within the same study root, followed by native Visual Studio
Build Tools installation with `--norestart`. Retry success remains pending.

Remote `preparation-tests.log` records all9 CPU tests passing with exit0.
The source archive and subsequent preparation patch were verified and extracted
into the fixed study root. Preparation files are committed on the dedicated
branch; inherited Qwen3.5 source edits remain separate and uncommitted. No GPU
benchmark has run. A prior whole-tree whitespace check also reports inherited
Qwen3.5 issues; those are not attributed to this task. The preparation manifest's
own CRLF-only whitespace issue was fixed in a separate commit.

## P004 — 2026-10-23: reproducible inherited baseline and native build

Committed the previously inherited CUDA working snapshot separately as
`2355fc4b5`. This supersedes P000/P003's earlier uncommitted-baseline status;
the original checkout is unchanged. The commit is baseline preservation, not
a new optimization or performance result.

Local full-source configuration initially failed because Cargo was absent from
the build shell PATH. Adding the existing local Cargo installation allowed
configuration. Compilation then failed at XLang3 `sre_module.cpp:5109`:
`std::regex_constants::multiline` is unavailable in the installed MSVC STL.
These initial failures are retained as observed diagnostic excerpts here;
complete per-attempt raw logs were not preserved before the log path was reused.
Future build logs must append or retain each attempt before reuse.

Method change: an optional native-Windows CMake wrapper links Garnet against a
preserved existing Release XLang3 DLL/import library and matching public SDK.
It does not change or rebuild the VM. XLang3 executable SHA-256 is
`2e2db12a2dbc1134a3a4c662c080b91d500b37af488661630d4d580e7684dc10`;
runtime DLL SHA-256 is
`8dabab841d460120b4e0b5c1539851e9ff17dbb0f5113beece4017f9f3fac4b3`.
Record this binary dependency, not an unsupported claim that the captured VM
source was rebuilt successfully. The wrapper copies the executable alongside
Garnet for native package discovery. Its initial imported-executable path
caused three module-discovery failures; corrected the path and reran those checks.

## P005 — 2026-10-23: exact model and tensor-header contracts

Added the dedicated Qwen3.8-27B contract and logical projection shapes under
`xModel/qwen38/vl_27b`. The offline preflight uses that same contract. It checks
the gated attention shape, untied head, 64-layer hybrid schedule, larger vision
tower, multimodal rotary layout and token IDs. Runtime admission remains off.

Method: bounded official HTTP range requests fetched the three pinned NVIDIA
safetensors headers, without weight payloads. Preserve exact raw header bytes,
their SHA-256 hashes, immutable source URLs, index and audit result in
`test2026/cuda/qwen38_5090/evidence/nvfp4-headers`. All497 logical text projections
match their physical tensor layouts:193 NVFP4,208 FP8 and96 BF16. NVFP4 matrices
are U8 packed with half-width columns, FP8 block16 scales and FP32 scalar scale2;
FP8 projections have scalar FP32 scales. BF16 in_proj_a/b remain unquantized.
Indexed tensor payload is21921428072 bytes. This is checkpoint storage, not VRAM.
Scale payload values, packing nibble arithmetic and GPU kernels remain unverified.

## P006 — 2026-10-23: separate BF16 head correctness groundwork

Problem: the prior CUDA I/O head always projected with the embedding table.
The 27B checkpoint has an independent lm_head. Implemented a separate BF16 head
when present; both full logits and indexed proposal heads use it. Missing untied
heads and unsupported packed heads fail before embedding allocation, rather
than silently changing the model. Accounting distinguishes shared embeddings
and separate-head allocation. This does not yet implement the packed NVFP4 head.

Method: native Windows Release build, CUDA13.2.78, TensorRT10.16.1.11, SM89,
preserved XLang3 runtime above. Ran tiny independent exact-integer BF16 fixtures
on local RTX4080 device1 (driver617.14), not the RTX5090. Five checks pass:
distinct head logits/unchanged embeddings, tied behavior, reopening, packed-head
rejection and missing-head rejection. Synthetic fixture outcomes, binary/source
hashes and exact patch are in `evidence/native-head`. Tested Garnet DLL hash:
`816648a65f5d7b162e29db95e3e7990fd689f3357fb143548d0af6ccb50d1e14`.

Native API and serving-default CTests pass. Broader production capture does not
pass: its initial stale27-module inventory was updated for the two already
present helper modules; it now reaches29 imports and nine root captures before
failing in ASR prefill with `TypeError: object is not callable` at T.unary_op.
Retain the full failing gate log. Its baseline/runtime cause remains unresolved;
do not describe the entire regression suite as passing or infer pretrained
Qwen3.8 correctness from the small head fixtures.

Sixteen CPU tests pass, including actual pinned header layout/hash validation,
negative architecture and quantization cases, timing arithmetic and a synthetic
download integrity/budget test. None is a benchmark measurement.

## P007 — 2026-10-23: target setup and verified download route

CMake4.4.4, Ninja1.13.2 and Visual Studio2022 Build Tools17.14.42 installed on
CD-RTX5090. User explicitly approved restart; restarted and reconnected.
WSL3.0.3 now responds. Ubuntu24.04 installation is running under a retained SSH
job handle; the distro/GPU path is not yet verified. A pinned CUDA13.2/TensorRT
10.16.1.11 Python-package toolchain install is also running in the fixed tools
folder. It uses NVIDIA's official package index, including its nvidia.cn CDN.

Direct Hugging Face access from the target timed out; a mirror returned403 and
was not pursued. An official expiring public CDN URL resolved on the local
machine succeeds from the target with a206 response and exact8-byte header.
Prepared small metadata plus four official CDN artifact tasks for the pinned
NVFP4 checkpoint. Download helper verifies primary LFS SHA-256 values and byte
counts, uses partial files for resume, publishes only verified artifacts, and
keeps signatures out of permanent provenance. One shared model directory is
used; no BF16 base-model or duplicate framework model copies are requested.

No text/image TTFT, decode speed, concurrency throughput, peak VRAM, pretrained
quality comparison or >=2x performance result has been measured. These goals
remain active; the native head change is correctness groundwork only.

## P008 — 2026-10-23: download and SDK status correction

The official-CDN model download is now live, with one1.97GB shard and tokenizer
verified and both larger shards making progress. The permanent result is not
complete until every declared artifact passes its primary SHA-256 check.
Small metadata has been staged in the same shared model directory.

The first native SDK install exited0, but pip selected CUDA13.4.92 CRT/NVRTC/NVVM
components alongside the requested13.2 compiler/runtime. Installation success
does not prove a consistent toolchain. Added a complete requirements lock and
started replacement with `--no-deps`, preserving the first attempt log. Only
the SDK folder generated by this task is replaced; models and deployment data
are untouched. Validate final versions and compilation before any timed run.

## P009 — 2026-10-23: append-only evidence ledger

Added `run_logged.py` for build/setup/correctness commands. One fixed directory
contains an append-only JSONL ledger and raw output log with per-command byte
offsets, command arguments, UTC times, source identity/diff hashes, selected safe
environment fields, artifact hashes and actual exit codes. Process duration is
explicitly not model latency. Copied remote source uses external manifest hashes
and the study commit record. Never use this wrapper for authentication commands.

Tests verify that successful and failed commands both remain in the ledger and
that process duration cannot be relabeled as a benchmark. The initial ledger
test exposed an unclosed stdout stream; fixed it with process context ownership
and retained both attempts. All18 CPU tests pass in the latest recorded run.
The two commands printed by the ledger unit test are synthetic fixtures, not
new model measurements. Original unit-test/logging output stays under the
fixed local `out/study-evidence` directory.

The fully pinned SDK replacement has now exited0 on CD-RTX5090. Package install
success still requires a subsequent native compile/runtime test. Two model
shards and tokenizer are verified; the remaining shard continues downloading.
Ubuntu installation still has a confirmed live job handle and no terminal
result; do not start another distro installer solely because its log is empty.

## P010 — 2026-10-23: model ready, target validation and packaging fixes

The model downloader finished with exit0: all four CDN artifacts passed their
declared byte counts and primary LFS SHA-256 checks. The three weight shards
and tokenizer total21934506600 bytes. Small metadata remains a separate pinned
archive/provenance set. No inference or memory-fit claim follows from download.

Updated copied source verification reports6337 files with zero mismatches and
commit1dd69410e. All18 CPU tests also pass on CD-RTX5090, with raw output and
manifest identity retained in its command ledger. The additional18 copied
SDK/runtime files passed hash verification. CUDA compiler reports13.2.78.

Ubuntu installation finished with exit0. An actual root-shell GPU check reports
Ubuntu24.04.5 LTS and RTX5090/32607MiB/driver617.14 inside WSL. This establishes
GPU visibility, not framework baseline readiness or measured serving performance.

First target native configure passed MSVC/CUDA compiler checks but failed in
legacy FindCUDA because a backslash path was interpreted as an escape. Normalized
the CUDA path and retried. The next configure found CUDA13.2 but exposed a
runtime-packaging mismatch: official Windows wheels place cuBLAS DLLs under
bin/x86_64, while Garnet searched bin and bin/x64. Added the x86_64 runtime
discovery path, retaining the existing paths. Development import libraries
missing from the wheels were supplied from the matching local CUDA13.2 SDK and
checked by SHA-256. These are build/deployment changes, not an inference speedup.
Both failed configure attempts are retained in the append-only target ledger.

## P011 — 2026-10-23: image runtime and portable dependency closure

Completed the SDK's image dependency set with NPP13.1.0.48 and nvJPEG13.1.0.48,
matching the component versions in the local CUDA13.2 version.json. The wheel
merger checked member hashes, refused conflicting existing files, installed44
files and removed temporary wheel downloads. Its actual setup job exited0.
Added both packages to the SDK lock. The build/runtime discovery now also
includes cuBLASLt, NPP core and CUDA runtime DLLs, avoiding reliance on a global
older CUDA installation when loading the packaged Garnet runtime.

No model inference benchmark has run. The next target step is a fresh native
SM120 build, followed by the small head fixtures and quantized projection work.
